- The way IMAP manage UID is a terrible mess. A different UID will be given to an email depending on the mailbox.
  Furthermore that UID might apparently change in case the IMAP loses it indexes or something (seems quite rare though)
  What is sure is that a UID will never refer to a different message.
  It will either stay valid and point to the same email or become invalid.

- The above issue is causing me problem because when I delete emails in a specific mailbox, I have no way to find that email
  in other mailbox (the UID is different). So that email will still appear if we look in another mail
